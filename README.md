# BNPL

Retail industry has reported the emergence of “Buy now pay later” (BNPL) within the mobile app platform business. The idea is
for the retail company to tie up with FinTech who would in turn provide free credit line for the mobile users of the retail company. 
There are two kinds of Buy Now Pay Later options. One is the Interest-free option available to the consumer which is sub-vented 
by the brand. In this model brands bear the cost, this is because Fintech has enabled a sale for them which otherwise would have 
not been possible if the consumer did not have an incentive to pay it in instalments at no extra cost.
